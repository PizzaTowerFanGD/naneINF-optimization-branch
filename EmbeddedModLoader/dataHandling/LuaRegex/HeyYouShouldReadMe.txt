NONE OF THIS IS RELEVANT ANYMORE AND HAS BEEN FIXED





NOTE FROM 3XPL ON APRIL 23 2025
this regex module has issues with detecting the range of the matches it actually finds (which is kinda funny)
this is a VERY heavily editted version of https://github.com/Roblox/luau-regexp/tree/main to move it from luau to luajit
and to fix those really weird issues (which i partially succeeded at)? i also changed the syntax quite a bit

the biggest issue with this module was that matchall() absolutely did not work in the slightest which is a huge reason why
injection is so slow,

another issue is that sometimes the spans for injections are still 1-2 characters off causing bleeding issues (which is weirdly somewhat 'fixed') by adding
a debugging comment after every regex injection, somewhat because some patches have an extra space or whatever idk
for example: this patch right here!

[patches.regex]
target = 'functions/common_events.lua'
pattern = '_c.config'
position = 'at'
payload = 'cfg'

i believe ive found a newer version of the roblox regex module with these issues fixed, but I have not tested it yet
